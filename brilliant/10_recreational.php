                        Abu Dhabi features a great variety of leisure activities, both indoor and outdoor. If you’re teaching in Abu Dhabi, there’s no reason to fear boredom in your free time! As a wealthy country where many citizens have disposable income and free time, there is a very wide array of leisure options. Sporty or lazy, in the city or out in the desert, on land or on the water: whatever you feel like doing, you can probably do it in Abu Dhabi.

                    <p class="h3">Outdoor Activities</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The desert provides outdoor space a plenty – it’s a giant playground where you can go off-roading, ride sand buggies, hike up mountains or explore city parks, beaches or a more remote oasis. There are several tour companies that offer packages to go out into the desert in case you didn’t bring your own 4×4. Off the coast of Abu Dhabi are several islands that have been settled since ancient times. They can be reached by ferry, and offer a completely different experience of a country that most people know only as a desert. As usual in countries around the Middle East, the time of day to go outside for a stroll, a run or a bike ride is around dusk, when the temperature is lower and the sunset provides the perfect backdrop. You’ll notice few people outside during the noon hours, especially in summer.
