                        There is perhaps no better way to discover the rustic lifestyle of Bedouins and admire the enchanting mountain scenery than by a taking a half-day trip to Hatta Heritage Village, with Rayna Tours. This trip will for sure provide you with a refreshing experience, as we drive you past the Hatta’s rocky trails and lush landscape bestowed with windy gorges, wadis,and dry river beds. You can take a plunge into one of the translucent mountain pools for a revitalizing dip, before we proceed you to the historic village of Hatta whose highlights include a 16th century fort that once served as the residence of the village’s old sheikh and an ancient mosque, aside from a string of houses built using clay. After a hearty lunch, our team will lead you to street souks, where you can shop items like unique carpets and hand-made pottery.
