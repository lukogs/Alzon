                            Upon a picturesque drive through tapered trails and hair-pin curves engraved out of the magnificent Hajar Mountains, we’ll lead you to Dibba Harbor where you can board a traditional Omani wooden dhow reflecting Bedouin style decor with beautiful carpets and comfortable pillows. In glorious sunshine, as the dhow drifts along the fjords flanked by mountains, you’ll feel that you’re a world away from the daily hustles of life. The scenery is strikingly beautiful with all silence and tranquility around you. If you’re a water sport aficionado, go for an exhilarating banana boat ride, try fishing, or plummet into the emerald green waters to swim or snorkel to take in the diversity of exuberant the underwater world. After all, the water of Musandam is a sanctuary for an incredible range of fish as well as other marine life.
