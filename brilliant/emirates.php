                        An Emirates ID is a mandatory document issued by the UAE government, namely the Federal Office of Identity and Citizenship, to all UAE citizens and residents (even newborn children). The ID confirms your identity and your personal data across all 7 Emirates in the country. Every individual who permanently resides in the country must apply for this document. In this article, we have prepared a simple guide on how to apply for an ID card, what documents you need to provide, the cost of the procedure, as well as how to replace/renew or dispose of the ID card.

                        <b>About the Emirates ID</b>
                        The Emirates ID is an identity document that every citizen and resident of the UAE must possess and is issued by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA). Even newborns and children must have this type of document. ).Identity cards in the Emirates are not divided by age, but rather by the type of residence:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Citizen ID card - for UAE nationals
                                </li>
                            <li>GCC ID card - for GCC nationals living in the UAE
                                </li>
                            <li>Expat ID card - for Expatriate residents</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                        All three types of cards are essentially the same. However, the validity of the Citizen Card depends on the citizen's choice of 5 or 10 years. Whereas a GCC ID is issued only for 5 years and Expat IDâ€™s can be issued for a period of 1, 2 or 3 years.

                        The Emirates ID consists of several components, which ensure the security and accuracy of the cardholder's information, these are an identification number, electronic chip and personal data. The identification number is one of the most important components of the Emirates ID. With this number, you can receive public services that require the use of an identity card and a personal identification number.The number is issued only once and consists of 15 numbers. The chip contains the ID cardholder's personal information including biometric data and fingerprints. This can be read by machines designed specifically for this purpose and can only be accessed by authorized bodies to provide the holder's information.

                        In addition to the personal information available on the Emirates ID chip, the cardholder has basic personal data on the front and back of the card. On the front of the ID, in addition to the ID number and chip, there is information such as name, nationality and a photo. On the back, you can see the gender, date of birth, card number and the cardholder's signature.

                        In November 2020, a new design of identity cards were introduced. They are now provided with additional visual and electronic security features, such as a 3D image of the cardholder and encoded data, which can only be read through the E-link system with the ICA. Such measures have been taken to combat identity fraud.
