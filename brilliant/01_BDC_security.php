                        Security has become one of the most important factors governing
                        everyday life. If you are working in an office, there are guards
                        present 24*7, and the facility is also monitored by CCTV cameras.
                        With a security system in place, it becomes easier to monitor the
                        premises and also gather information of an incident. The cameras
                        have to be placed at strategic locations, and for that a special
                        team of surveillance experts is required. As BDC IT Solutions,So
                        we entitle our clients with an exclusive service provided by the
                        aces of IT support.
