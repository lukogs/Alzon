                            <b>Tour Overview</b> <br>
                            UAE is more than just its opulent shopping malls, glitzy skyscrapers and bustling roads, and a testimony of this fact is its Northern Emirates drenched in natural beauty. Rayna’s Fujairah-East Coast tour is one of the best ways to explore the other side of the nation, with its mountainous terrain, historic points of interests and archeological sites. Fujairah – though the smallest – is perhaps the most scenic as well as unique of all the emirates in the UAE. With the majestic Hajar Mountains that is known for its contrasting colors as its backdrop, Fujairah is highly favored for its unspoiled lush landscape and secluded coastline that stretches for more than 70 kilometers.

                        While enabling you to get a glimpse of Eastern Sights of Oasis of Al Dhaid and Masafi and Sharjah, our tour itinerary will cover a visit to such tourist spots as the oldest mosque at Bidya and Friday Market where you can shop a variety of one-of-a-kind traditional items. We’ll then head to Heritage Village with an assortment of traditional houses and fishing boats that throw light on the UAE’s past life. For a short break, there will be a stopover at Khorfakkan beach – a safe haven to enjoy activities such as swimming. This will be followed by a lunch break that allows you to savor wholesome meal while enjoying the nature at its best and a visit to the souk lined with a number of shops selling fresh harvested vegetables and fruits.
