                        Signage plays a key role in our everyday life and at every business. It
                        can help a business maintain its branding, help customers find their
                        way around, provide useful tips and information and more. When a
                        building is well planned and signs are posted properly, you tend to
                        have a better overall experience- particularly as a first time customer.
                        Digital Signage is a frequently undervalued aspect of doing business.
                        In the service industry, signs direct customers to the places they
                        need to go, inform them of special deals or rates, and they can even
                        help a business set the atmosphere with a theme or unique
                        terminology.
