                            Hike the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa and check out an eagle-eye view of the stunning contrast of Dubai's landscape from its two observation decks. Depending on your Burj Khalifa tickets, you will be granted access to one or both of them. It is only here that you can experience the fastest double-deck elevator, cruising at 10m/sec.
