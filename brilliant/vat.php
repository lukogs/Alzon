                        With the UAE VAT tax reforms introduced in 2018, all companies in the UAE are subject to VAT registration and filing periodically. The Federal Tax Authority of UAE will act as the governing body for all VAT regulations and compliance.
                        <br>
                        The UAE and other GCC countries have introduced Value Added Tax (VAT) since 2018. Currently, there is 5% VAT for all transactions in UAE with exemptions on certain services like local transport, selected financial services, bare land, etc.

                        <b>GENERAL CRITERIA FOR VAT REGISTRATION IN UAE</b>
                        <br>
                        A business must register for VAT if its taxable supplies and imports exceed AED 375,000 per annum. It is optional for businesses whose supplies and imports exceed AED 187,500 per annum. By end of 2018, all companies in UAE are voluntarily required to register for VAT even if their annual revenue is less than AED 375,000 per annum.
                        <br>
                        The VAT is charged at each step of the supply chain. The end consumers generally bear the VAT cost while Businesses collect and account for the tax, in a way acting as a tax collector on behalf of the government. Companies have to keep a record of their financial transactions and ensure the accounts are audited periodically so that they stay compliant with the VAT regulations and avoid any default.
